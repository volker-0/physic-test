# Qode

Qode is a lightly modified fork of Node.js that allows Node's event loop to be merged with Qt's or any other Gui event loop.
It is designed to be used together with `@nodegui/nodegui`. Qode achieves this by allowing message loop injection via a NodeJS addon.

Qode allows you to run both Qt and Node's event loops in the same thread. This is crucial to achieving low CPU footprint.
Qode can be used as a _drop in_ replacement of NodeJS and hence you could consider it as NodeJS with Qt powers ðŸ’ª.

This npm module downloads the prebuilt qode for the current Operating System.
